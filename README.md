# STA141C Project: 311 Cases

The “311 Cases” dataset contains non-emergency cases from the city and county of San Francisco. The dataset contains 4.8 million observations, in which each case has information like CaseID, request type, and location. Our project attempts to answer these questions:
* Q1: Based on the category of the request and neighborhood, how long does it take for a case to be closed? 
* Q2: Given 1 day has passed, what is the predicted case status?
* Q3: Given the request type, what is the predicted time of day?
* Q4: Are specific 311 cases associated with a certain price level of cars? 
* Q5: What categories of cases have the best success rate?
* Q6: Is the frequency of cases reported related to either the population or median income of a neighborhood?
* Q7: Do cases that have not been closed share similar attributes? 
  
Note: Q1 and Q2 were completed by Serena
