For all noise issues, we try our best to accommodate the needs of San Francisco citizens by making adjustments when possible. Details such as location of sound, time, description of the truck, truck #, service address(es), service the truck is providing, etc. can help us pinpoint the cause and driver(s). In some cases, going at other times can potentially cause traffic and safety challenges; the latter being our number one priority.

This is true in this particular instance. With this type of truck and maneuvering, the service is more dangerous the later it is given more pedestrians, bicyclists, and cars on the roads.

Just as an FYI, all Recology trucks operate under the permitted 75 dBA. As a result of the sanitation service we provide, SFDPH 4.2 Police Code Article 29, Section 2904, Waste Disposal Services, states ""There are no limits on noise associated with refuse truck operation, such as noise from crushing, compacting, dropping, or moving waste"".",Recology_Noise,Noise Report,garbage_recycling_collection,Noise Report - garbage_recycling_collection,"1625 MONTGOMERY ST, SAN FRANCISCO, CA, 94111",MONTGOMERY ST,3,Telegraph Hill,CENTRAL,37.8040758,-122.4052486,"(37.8040758, -122.4052486)",Web,,18,6,3,23,10,3,1,28860,1,23,23,,18,,3,,,,,,,1,,,,,18
